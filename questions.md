<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
<p>Some best practices for creating effective wireframes include keeping them simple, using consistent elements and styles, and creating multiple versions to explore different options. Wireframes help with the design process by providing a visual representation of the layout and structure of a web page or application. They allow designers to test and refine the user experience before moving on to more detailed design work.</p>
<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
<p>User testing is a crucial part of the design process, as it allows designers to gather feedback from actual users and make informed decisions about how to improve the user experience. In the case of user interfaces and wireframes, user testing can reveal issues with navigation, layout, and usability. For example, in a project to redesign a mobile app, user testing revealed that users were struggling to find key features, which led to a redesign of the app's navigation and a more streamlined layout.</p>

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful in developing websites?</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for developing responsive websites. It includes a collection of pre-built CSS and JavaScript components, such as navigation menus, forms, and buttons, that can be easily integrated into a website's design. Bootstrap also provides a responsive grid system, making it easier to create a website that looks good on a variety of devices.</p>
<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to CSS?</h2>
<p>One of the main benefits of using Bootstrap is that it allows developers to save time by using pre-built components and layouts, rather than having to create everything from scratch with CSS. Bootstrap also provides a consistent look and feel across a website, making it easier to maintain and update. Additionally, because Bootstrap is a popular framework, there are many resources and tutorials available for developers to learn from.</p>
<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>
<p>To include Bootstrap in your website development, you can download the framework from the official website and link to the CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML code. Alternatively, you can use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to link to the Bootstrap files remotely. Once you have included the Bootstrap files, you can start using the pre-built components and layouts in your website design.</p>
<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>
<p>Selectors in CSS are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. One example of a selector is the class selector, which targets elements with a specific class attribute. To use a class selector, you add a period before the class name in your CSS code. For example, if you want to apply a red background color to all elements with the class "highlight", you would use the selector ".highlight" in your CSS code.</p>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
<p>In the snake game, selection is used to determine whether the snake has collided with a wall or with its own body. Iteration is used to move the snake one block at a time, and to check whether it has collided with food.
